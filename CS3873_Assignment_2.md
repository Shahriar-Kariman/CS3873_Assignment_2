<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
  <li>False very false first you get one response message then you find out you need to send 3 more responses.</li>
  <li>False it is litterally in the name non-persistent.</li>
  <li>False that is the date the response was generated.</li>

## Question 2 - Wireshark Capture

### Part A - Complete URL

I belive the URL would be `http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/cs453/index.html`

### Part B - HTTP Version

The browser is using HTTP 1.1

### Part C - Type of Connection

The browser is using persistent connection hence why we see `connection:keep-alive`

### Part D - File Type

The file requested is `index.html` which is an html file.
